# gRPC Image Processing Server

This Grpc python server provides two microservice 
##### 1. Image Rotate Request
        Rotates the input image in multiple of 90 degree based on input argument.
##### 2. Mean Filter
        Computes and return the mean image for given input image.



### 1. File contents

    1. server   -- contains code for Server to interact with client 
    2. client   -- contains code for Client to connect to server and make request and recieve response.
    3. utils.py    -- contains image processing utility function used in server.py and client.py
    4. setup    -- executable for setting up the system
    5. build    -- to generate image_pb2_grpc.py and image_pb2.py files


### 2. Setup

This setup applies for fresh Ubuntu 18.04 
1. Download and save the the folder at desired location
2. Python3           : ```sudo apt-get update```;```sudo apt-get install python3```
3. Pip3              : ```sudo python3 -m pip install pip```; ```python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip```
4. requirements.txt  : ```python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt```

Setup can be installed by using following executable
```bash
./setup
```

### 3. Build
To generate image_pb2_grpc.py and image_pb2.py run following executable
```bash
./build
```

### 4. Instruction
</br>

#### 4.1 Server 
To start the server run following command
```bash
`./server --port <...> --host <...>`
```
Parameters and their default values:

>```port```: **```50051```** &nbsp; - &nbsp; port number to connect to <br/>
>```host```: **```localhost```** &nbsp; - &nbsp; host to connect to <br/>
</br>

#### 4.2 Client
For client run following command
```bash
`./client --port <...> --host <...> --input <...> --output <...> --rotate <...> --mean`
```
Parameters and their default values:

>```port```: **```50051```** &nbsp; - &nbsp; port number to connect to <br/>
>```host```: **```localhost```** &nbsp; - &nbsp; host to connect to <br/>
>```input```: **```Required Parameter```** &nbsp; - &nbsp; input file path <br/>
>```output```: **```Required Parameter```** &nbsp; - &nbsp; output folder path <br/>
>```rotate```: **```NONE```** &nbsp; - &nbsp; Rotation enum representing rotation degree  <br/>
>```mean```: **```optional```** &nbsp; - &nbsp; specifies that the mean filter should be
run on the input image  <br/>
</br>

### 5. Concerns

Both the microservices deals with image data and uses Unary RPCs where the client sends 
a single request to the server and gets a single response back, just like a normal function call. 
1. This limits the amount of data that can be transferred and thus limit the operation speed.
2. Unary RPCs can be useful for smaller payloads, but for images, where data is frequently greater 
than the normal payload, we actually require partial upload of data due to latency concerns or network problems, 
and so basic unary requests to upload images on a backend framework are unreliable. 

### 6. Improvement Suggestions / Future Work
1. Streaming RPC can be a alternative way which we can use larger image files. It transfer larger file 
in smaller bits called chunk. Chunking serves two useful purpose </br>
a) reduce the maximum amount of memory required to process each message <br/>
b) provide a boundary for recovering partial uploads. <br/>
2. Unit test can be added to further improve the code quality.
3. We can stress test the server code to figure out the throughput of this service and also if itâ€™s CPU and/or MEM intensive
4. Scan input image in the input request for malicious content to safeguard the service from attacks.
5. Make the service multi-process so that a single bulky request does not block other requests from getting processed. Python has an inherent bottleneck of GIL which limits parallel processing.
6. We also need to figure out the upper bound limit on the input image size if this interface needs to have strict SLAs.
